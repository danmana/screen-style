Free Wallpapers website with donations
screen.style
(see mkbd fiasco with the panels wallpaper app)
create a meme free wallpapers site
start with 100-500 ai generated wallpapers for various categories
- phone mode initially (add desktop later)
- all wallpapers are free to download (no login required)
- clean design, no ads
- users ca "donate" 5$ or their choice to get custom wallpapers based on a prompt provided by them - their name will be listed on the wallpaper in the app
- when a user donates, they can fill in a prompt, pick some categories, color scheme etc (for every 1$ they get 5-10 wallpapers?) -> wallpapers are then generated with Flux and a link is sent to their email. Their name will be visible for others as "Donated by @xxxx"
- users get a personal page where they can link their twitter, and add some links/text


How to generate nice wallpapers? 
- use flux-dev / flux-pro. 
- use gpt4o to generate a good prompt
- future: use different LoRas for each style/category (ex: pixel art, realistic, etc)
