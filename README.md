## V1 Free Wallpapers
- filter by "style"
- download for free
- no ads, no paywall, no login
- a button with "Buy me a coffee" & I will make 5-10-20 new free wallpapers for each coffee (based on the style requested by the user)


### Roadmap
- [ ] implement v1
- [ ] add 100 wallpapers (5 styles)
- [ ] add 500 wallpapers (10 styles)
- [ ] add a twitter link for the user that "donated" a wallpaper
- [ ] track the number of downloads for each wallpaper, so we can sort by popular
- [ ] automate donations with gtpt4o and replicate API, so I don't have to make them by hand (or at least simplify my process)
- [ ] "donation" form: users can fill in a style description, color scheme, twitter handle etc 
- [ ] send email to donors with link to the generated wallpapers
- [ ] personal user page with their generated/donated wallpapers
- [ ] desktop wallpapers
- [ ] view top donors?
- [ ] future: use different LoRas for each style/category (ex: pixel art, realistic, etc)
